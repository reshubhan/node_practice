What is node ?
Node js is server side javascript used for real time apps like 
chat applications
Real time applications and collaborative environments
game servers
Ad servers 
Streaming servers

Node is great when you need high level of concurrency and little dedicated CPU time 
Great for writing javascript code every where 
Node is not a silver bullet. It’s designed for I/O-intensive operations and shines in building fast, scalable and real-time network applications. Examples of these applications are online games, collaboration tools, chat systems, etc. With Node, you can serve a great many clients with minimal system resources, and that’s why it’s designed for high scalability.
Node is also an excellent choice for building APIs on top of a document database like MongoDB. You store your documents as JSON objects in Mongo and expose them via a RESTful API. No need to convert between JSON and other types when reading or writing from your database.
Node, due to its architecture, should not be used for CPU-intensive operations. 

Where node should not be used?
Places where there is lot of cpu utilization may be a place where there is a very big calculation and it takes whole lot of cpu because it will be blocking all other process 

Places where node is being used ?
Microsoft (Azure mobile service)
yahoo
LinkedIn
ebay
Dow jones
New york times

More about node?

Its community is huge
Its is 3rd most popular repo on github
Over 2 million downloads per month
over 20 million downloads of v0.10x
over 81000 modules on npm
over 475 meet ups talking about it worldwide

Reference :- https://strongloop.com/node-js/nodejs-infographic/

what is npm?
Node package module, has 81000 modules
https://www.npmjs.com/
official pacakge manager for node 
bundled and installed automatically with the environment if you do npm install --save pacakge_name 
it will save to pacakge.json file in form of dependencies in node_modules folder

What is package.json in node?
Its a like a file where u specify depencies / verison /author details etc, its basically like teling these are the libraries used in project and this is the author who created it etc.


Error how/fix?

error:- In most cases you are behind a proxy or have bad network settings.
Fix :- use npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
so that npm requests for http url instead of https.


What is event driven programming?
Its basically wehn the program no longer executes lineraly rather then by events based
one event executs and then second event and it is done by node event loop feature
It starts automactically and stays till the last call back is called.


Node is single thread?
Node is single thread, which means if you execute anything which paauses the process, it will pause everything elese
like sleep funtion, it pauses everything , so event loop will also pause

Blocking i/o?

Like file reading, its like a blockign i/o, which block the whole process untill nad unless the whole file is read.

Now this is cpu intensive process, where node may not be the best use 

what is a call back?
Call back helps us to break a big program into chunks to map to data , this is needed so that ur prgram does nto freeze event loop 
by long running programs 


What is a promise in node ?
Promise are functions which promises to return object in future, so its like i promise u i will return u somethoing or the other etiher data or error, or exectpion anything 

What is a MEAN stack?
MEAN stands for:
MongoDB: the database engine we use to store the data.
Express.js: the server-side framework for building web applications, similar to ASP.NET MVC or Rails.
Angular: the front-end framework for building web applications  
Node.js: the Javascript runtime environment



Note :- 
In 2013, as explained on their blog, PayPal moved from Java to Node.js. LinkedIn also moved from Rails to Node.
